# Reddit-Bot-Classifier

This is the code I used for my Reddit Bot Classifer report.

### classifier.py

This file does all of the Reddit user classification and also has functions to create all of the visualization found in my report.

### user_scraper.py

This file scrape data from Reddit and inserts it into a mongdo db. To use this code you must have set up a mongo db in your local environment.
